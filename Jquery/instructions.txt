RIGHTS
The code is free to use both for personal and commercial use, however, a link back to my article would be highly appreciated and it would help others find this script and its tutorial. Be a sport, be a good contributor :-)

USAGE
- load the countdown.js and countdown.css files.
- in your html page where you want to add the countdown, add this inside the <head></head> element

<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function() {
	
		$("#countdown").countdown({
			date: "23 february 2012 1:50:30", // add the countdown's end date (i.e. 3 november 2012 12:00:00)
			format: "on" // on (03:07:52) | off (3:7:52) - two_digits set to ON maintains layout consistency
		},
		
		function() { 
			
			// the code here will run when the countdown ends
			alert("done!") 

		});
	});
</script>

- adjust the date and format settings as you wish.
- remove the alert("done!") function and add your own callback code that you want the countdown to run once it ends.

HTML
<ul id="countdown">
	<li>
		<span class="days">00</span>
		<p class="timeRefDays">days</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="hours">00</span>
		<p class="timeRefHours">hours</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="minutes">00</span>
		<p class="timeRefMinutes">minutes</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="seconds">00</span>
		<p class="timeRefSeconds">seconds</p>
	</li>
</ul>

Enjoy,
